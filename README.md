#### Welcome to OleoPhase

This repository aims to compile all relevant experimental data related to liquidâ€“liquid phase equilibria in biodiesel and oleochemical systems. The data has been gathered from peer-reviewed publications, with full references provided in the experimental_data folder and within the database script. After collection, the data was carefully processed to produce a refined and consistent dataset suitable for thermodynamic modeling and data-driven model development. The objective of this work is to provide both academia and industry with a curated resource that supports the advancement of oleochemical process design and optimization. All code used for data processing is also included in this repository.

In future updates, correlated group interaction parameters for the UNIFAC and UNIFAC Dortmund thermodynamic models will be made available, along with their Python implementations. Additionally, a machine learning model trained on the refined dataset will be shared to facilitate rapid estimation of phase behavior in related systems.
